# Overview

In this workshop we will examine how to conduct Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) in R. We will begin by exploring why we tend to use ANOVA (rather than multiple *t*-tests), before moving on to some examples of ANOVA for between participants and repeated measures designs.

After you've watched both of the videos above, it's your turn to build your first ANOVA in R for a between participants design. This is the same data (from the same study) that I covered in the second of the two videos above. Follow the instructions below to build that model.

# Between Participants ANOVA
## Loading our Packages

First of all, we need to load the three packages we will be using - they are `tidyverse`, `afex`, and `emmeans`. The `afex::` package is the one we use for conducting factorial ANOVA. We use the `emmeans` package for running follow-up tests on the ANOVA model that we will be building.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(afex)
library(emmeans)
```

## Reading in our Data

We have 45 participants in a between participants design where we are interested in the effect of beverage consumed on ability on a motor task.  Our experimental factor (beverage type) has 3 levels.  These are Water vs. Single Espresso vs. Double Espresso, and Ability is our DV measured on a continuous scale. Let's read in our data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
my_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajstewartlang/11_glm_anova_pt1/master/data/cond.csv")
head(my_data)
```

We see that we have three variables, but our experimental variable `Condition` is not coded as a factor. Let's fix that...

```{r}
my_data_tidied <- my_data %>%
  mutate(Condition = factor(Condition))
head(my_data_tidied)
```

## Summary Statistics

Let's work our some summary statistics and build a data visualisation next.

```{r}
my_data_tidied %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Ability), sd = sd(Ability))
```

## Visualising our Data

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
my_data_tidied %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Condition, y = Ability, colour = Condition)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(width = .1) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", colour = "black") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 13)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We have built a visualisation where we have plotted the raw data points using the `geom_jitter()` function, and the shape of the distribution for each condition using the `geom_violin()` function. We have also added some summary data in the form of the Mean and Confidence Intervals around the Mean using the `stat_summary()` function.

## Building our ANOVA Model

Let's now build our model using the `aov_4()` function in the afex:: package. The syntax for ANOVA models in `aov_4()` is: `aov_4(DV ~ IV + (1 | Participant), data = my_data_tidied)`. The `~` symbol means predicted by, the `(1 | Participant)` term corresponds to our random effect - we obviously can't test all the participants in the world so have taken just a random sample from this population. Finally, we need to specify what dataset we are using by making that clear in the `data = my_data_tidied` bit of the model. We are going to map the output of the `aov()` function onto a variable I'm calling `model`. This means that the ANOVA results will be stored in this variable and will allow us to access them later.

```{r}
model <- aov_4(Ability ~ Condition + (1 | Participant), data = my_data_tidied)
```

To get the output of the ANOVA, we can use the `summary()` function with our newly created `model`.

## Interpreting the Model Output

```{r}
summary(model)
```

The effect size (ges) is generalised eta squared and for designs with more than one factor it can be a useful indicator of how much variance in the dependent variable can be explained by each factor (plus any interactions between factors).

So, we there is an effect in our model - the F-value is pretty big and the *p*-value pretty small) but we can't know what's driving the difference yet. We need to run some pairwise comparisons using the `emmeans()` function to tell us what mean(s) differ(s) from what other mean(s). 

```{r}
emmeans(model, pairwise ~ Condition)
```

Note that the default adjustment for multiple comparisons is Tukey's. We can change that by adding an extra parameter to our model such as `adjust = "bonferonni")`. In this case, it doesn't make any difference to our comparisons.

```{r}
emmeans(model, pairwise ~ Condition, adjust = "bonferroni")
```

We found a significant effect of Beverage type (F (2,42) = 297.05, *p* < .001, generalised η2 = .93). Tukey comparisons revealed that the Water group performed significantly worse than the Single Espresso Group (*p* < .001), that the Water group performed significantly worse than the Double Espresso Group (*p* < .001), and that the Single Espresso Group performed significantly worse than the Double Espresso Group (*p* < .001).

In other words, drinking some coffee improves motor performance relative to drinking water, and drinking a lot of coffee improves motor performance even more.

# Repeated Measures ANOVA

[video 3]

Now it's your chance to work with the data I examined in the video above. Let’s imagine we have an experiment where we asked 32 participants to learn how to pronounce words of differing levels of complexity - Very Easy, Easy, Hard, and Very Hard. They were presented with these words in an initial exposure phase. After a 30 minute break we tested participants by asking them to say the words out loud when they appeared on a computer screen. We recorded their times in seconds. We want to know whether there is a difference in their response times for each level of word complexity. 

## Reading in our Data

First we read in the data.
```{r, message=FALSE}
rm_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajstewartlang/11_glm_anova_pt1/master/data/rm_data.csv")
head(rm_data)
```

We can see from the `head()` function that Condition isn't yet coded as a factor. Let's fix that.
```{r}
rm_data_tidied <- rm_data %>%
  mutate(Condition = factor(Condition))
head(rm_data_tidied)
```

## Summary Statistics

Let's generate the Mean and Standard Deviation for each of our four conditions.
```{r}
rm_data_tidied %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(RT), sd = sd (RT))
```

## Visualising our Data

And visualise the data - note here that I am using the `fct_reorder()` function to reorder the levels of our factor based on the RT. This can be useful to make our viusalisations more easily interpretable.
```{r}
rm_data_tidied %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Condition, RT), y = RT, colour = Condition)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(width = .1) +
  guides(colour = FALSE) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", colour = "black") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 13)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Condition", y = "RT (s)")
```

## Building our ANOVA Model

We build our ANOVA model in a similar way as we did previously. Except in this case our random effect we define as `(1 + Condition | Participant)`. I order to capture the fact that our `Condition` is a repeated measures factor, we add it to the random effect term like this.

```{r}
rm_model <- aov_4(RT ~ Condition + (1 + Condition | Participant), data = rm_data_tidied)
```

## Interpreting the Model Output

We extract the summary of our model in the same way we did for the between participants ANOVA.

```{r}
summary(rm_model)
```

With this option, we didn't get the effect size measure in our measure. We can generate that though by asking for our model to be presented in anova format using the `anova()` function.

```{r}
anova(rm_model)
```

The effect size is measured by ges and is the recommended effect size measure for repeated measures designs (Bakeman, 2005). Note the dfs in this output are always corrected as if there is a violation of sphericity - to be conservative (and to avoid Type I errors) we might be better off to always choose these corrected dfs.

From this, we can see we have effect of Condition. But we don't know where the differences lie between the different levels of our factor. So we use the `emmeans()` function to find that out. Here we will be using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

```{r}
emmeans(rm_model, pairwise ~ Condition, adjust = "Bonferroni")

```

From the above we can see that all conditions differ from all other conditions, *apart* from the Easy vs. Very Easy comparison which is not significant.
